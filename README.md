# 📚 My Library App  
A JavaScript Project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) — JavaScript Foundations Curriculum

Welcome to **My Library**, a dynamic, interactive book tracking app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created as part of the hands-on learning section in *JavaScript Fundamentals*. Users can add, view, delete
and update the read status of books — all managed with an internal array and rendered directly to the page via DOM manipulation.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- 🧩 How to create and manage **JavaScript objects** using constructors  
- 🖱️ Dynamically **create and render HTML elements** using JS - a first for me just starting JS
- ✅ Use of **event listeners** for user interaction with HTML elements  
- 🔧 Learned how to use **Git CLI** over the GUI — a hair-pulling experience but rewarding experience in the end
- 💡 Reignited my passion for creating clean and unique designs on my projects
